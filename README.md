# local_noise_resampling


Qualitative results demonstrating the scalability and robustness of our noise re-sampling method on **complex scenes with many local regions**. On the left shows the original sd 1.5 generated image (top left), the enhanced image by our proposed method (bottom left), and corresponding zoom-in patches ( original and enhanced in second and third column). Top: a selfie with multiple people in close proximity. Bottom: several dogs in motion. Despite the presence of **densely packed and overlapping regions**, our method preserves **structural consistency and enhances local fidelity.**
